MATLAB Project Wizard Wizard will generate a project and will
request you to pick up a top level file to add to the project.
You can later use the M++ button from the MATLAB Visual Studio
Addin to add more files to the project.

The project contains:

test1.c		Main C file
test1.dsw		MSVC Developer Studio Workspace
test1.dsp		MSVC Developer Studio Project File
readme.txt	This text

To debug DLLs (MEX files or Simulink S-Functions) specify MATLAB.EXE
(e.g c:\MatlabR12\bin\win32\matlab.exe) as the Executable for Debug
Session.
