- color support

	when the image contains color element, or the color is to be considered important,
	then you can use the color-support feature in AE.
	the plugin should be designed with color-support also. (especially kernel plugins.)

	source graphics plugin may translate an RGB image to double quantified image, if
	'color' is in grayscale mode.
